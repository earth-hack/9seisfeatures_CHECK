# 9seisfeatures_CHECK
CHECK_9seisfeatures - EAGE_Earth Hack

## Description
Interpretation of seismic data is a crucial process in oil and gas exploration but it is time consuming and subjected to many uncertainties. 
In general, interpretation of seismic data involved identification of geological structures like faults, anticline, syncline and more, as well
as some direct hydrocarbon indicators. 

For this challenge, we are focusing in predicting fault interpretation in a 3D seismic data. We will selected out few sublines to focus on as 
interpreting the whole volumne of seismic data would be very time consuming and we need a bigger processing machine to work on it. 

After selecting the sublines from the whole volume,convert the subline data into ASCII format to be consumed into computer for machine learning work.
With the ASCII format file, we can convert the ASCII input into array for modelling. The modelling we used is Convolutional Neural Network.
